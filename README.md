# The-Library
The library project offers five choices to the user
1- Add a book: Provided that the ISBN is a number, otherwise an error will be raised for the user.
2- Borrowing a book: If the book actually exists, a letter will be printed for it.
3- Returning the book: The user is asked to write the ISBN correctly without errors, and a message is written to him about that, and the process is completed successfully.
4- Displaying the book list: This is information about the books, which includes (the name of the book, the author, the ISBN, the availability of the book?!: which answer is in Boolean).
5- Exit the program.
